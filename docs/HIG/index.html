                    <p>
                        Paper prototyping is the process of creating rough, often hand-sketched, drawings of a user
                        interface, and using them in a usability test to gather feedback.
                        Participants point to locations on the page that they would click, and screens are manually
                        presented to the user based on the interactions they indicate.

            <h3>10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</h3>
            <p>A heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method mainly used to identify any design issues
                associated with the user interface.</p>
            <p>Jakob Nielsen’s heuristics are probably the most-used usability heuristics for user interface design.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Visibility of system status</b>
                    <p>
                        The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate
                        feedback within reasonable time.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Match between system and the real world</b>
                    <p>
                        The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the
                        user, rather than system-oriented terms.
                        Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>User control and freedom</b>
                    <p>
                        Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked
                        "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.
                        Support undo and redo.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Consistency and standards</b>
                    <p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same
                        thing. Follow platform conventions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Error prevention</b>
                    <p>
                        Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring
                        in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users
                        with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Recognition rather than recall</b>
                    <p>
                        Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should
                        not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.
                        Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Flexibility and efficiency of use</b>
                    <p>Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert
                        user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to
                        tailor frequent actions.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Aesthetic and minimalist design</b>
                    <p>
                        Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit
                        of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes
                        their relative visibility.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</b>
                    <p>
                        Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem,
                        and constructively suggest a solution.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Help and documentation</b>
                    <p>
                        Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary
                        to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on
                        the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
                    </p>

            <p>Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap. Button pannel is left aligned
