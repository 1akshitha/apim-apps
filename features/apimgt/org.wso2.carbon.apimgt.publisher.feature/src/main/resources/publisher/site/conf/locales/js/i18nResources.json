These alerts could be treated as an indication of a slow backend.In technical terms, if the backend time of a particular API resource (eg: GET /calc/1.0/numbers) of a tenant, lies outside the Xth percentile value, we will send an alert out. Default percentile value is 95%. Here, we safely assume that the corresponding backend time of an API resource follows a normal distribution. Percentile value gets calculated daily by default. ",
